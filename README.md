## Project #1/6: Build a Random Quote Machine

**Summary:** This is a random quote generator built with React.  It grabs a random quote from a [quotes API](https://thesimpsonsquoteapi.glitch.me/) and displays it.

**How to use**:

1. Download the project files and extract the folder to your computer.
2. Navigate to the project directory via the terminal and run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.  A browser window will open to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) where you'll be able to view and use the app.


**Extra Credit**

1. Used React Hooks to manage state.
2. Used react-bootstrap instead of regular boostrap package.
3. Used react-transition-group to animate quote's appearance and entrance transitions.
